# Fibonacci Sequence Program

## Overview

This C program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified value of `n`. It uses a function to calculate the next Fibonacci number based on the previous two. The program includes comments for clarity and readability.

## Instructions

### 1. Compilation

Compile the program using a C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c -lm

### 2. Execution
Run the compiled program:
./fibonacci

### 3. Usage
Enter the desired value of n when prompted. The program will then display the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified value.

# Arctangent Approximation Program

## Overview

This C program calculates and compares two approximations of the arctangent function for a range of input values. The approximations are implemented in `archtanx1` and `archtanx2` functions. The program includes comments for clarity and readability.

## Instructions

### 1. Compilation

Compile the program using a C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc -o arctan_approx arctan_approx.c -lm

### 2. Execution
./arctan_approx

### 3. Usage
Enter the desired value of delta when prompted. The program will then display the difference between the arctangent approximations for a range of input values.
