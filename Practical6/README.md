# Matrix Multiplication Program
This program performs matrix multiplication of two matrices, Cn×q = An×pBp×q, where n = 5, p = 3, and q = 4. It initializes three arrays A, B, and C of type double, and populates them according to specified rules.

# Compilation:
  1. make 
  This will compile the main.c and matmult.c files and generate the executable named matmult.

  2. ./matmult
  This will execute the program, performing matrix multiplication and printing the results.
