# Polynomial Approximation of e

This program estimates the value of the mathematical constant 'e' using polynomial approximation. The user is prompted to input the order of the polynomial, and the program calculates and displays the approximated value of 'e' for each order from 1 to the specified order.

# How to use:
1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
   gcc -o prac7 prac7.c -lm

2. Run the executable:
   ./prac7

3. Enter the order of the polynomial when prompted.

4. The program will calculate and display the approximated value of 'e' for each order from 1 to the specified order.
